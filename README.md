# Convert HEIC files to JPG
This is a script that uses the Pillow and pillow-heif libraries to manipulate images in the HEIF format.

# Installation
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):

```bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # for Linux/Mac
myenv\Scripts\activate.bat  # for Windows
```
## Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The above command will read the requirements.txt file and install all the packages listed in it, along with their respective versions.

## Usage
To use the project, simply run the python file. Here's an example:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
This will run the main.py file, which imports the required libraries and contains the code to manipulate HEIF images.

## Note
Replace the heic files you want inside of the heic folder.
